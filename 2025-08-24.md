2. Tasks Completed:
   - Learned how to add, read, list and delete contents from shelve db
   - Learned that dealing with something like password manager which can store multiple accounts details for a name of app i should use dictionaries

3. Challenges / Issues:
   - Had some troubles with isinstance
   - Had some trouble with listing in dictionaries and lists so confused on where it belongs
   - Had some issues with processing the new information which i had to solve bit by bit
  

4. Solutions / Learnings:
   - Do more projects on shelve module
   - work more with functions, dictionaries and lists
   - Always take short breaks, i'll never skip that so i wont burn out
  

5. Notes / Ideas:
   - Im more good at function these days than usual
   - It's really cool handling nosql buh really needs calmness to demistify
   - Am not aiming for perfection i just want to do something that changes the world
   - I can do this no matter what each chapter throws at me
