Created the Form Validator CLI tool today. It’s designed to be easy to use, even for beginners, and helps users understand how to input details in a sign-up form with proper formats for passwords and other fields. I used regular expressions (regex) to validate each input for accuracy. By combining regex with a Python dictionary, I was able to store all the details entered and print them out after the validation process.

I faced several challenges debugging the code, but used AI assistance to refine it for valid and accurate results. Most of the work was done by me, and I’m proud of the outcome. I hope to build more tools in the future and look forward to learning more about input validation in Python. My goal is to work on new projects that can automate tasks and make tasks more easier. Looking forward to learning linux basics next and input validation next and work on new projects.
