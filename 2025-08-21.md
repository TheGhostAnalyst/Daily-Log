     depending on what's stored in it. 
   - I learnt how to modify list of files using glop patterns where regex comes in.
   - I built my directory flodder virus tool
   - Modified my web scrapper script to be recognized by other bots as a human with headers to avoid multiple ip flagging and blocking

   - There's actually a place where i can get dictionary of headers
   - Take few breaks
  

5. Notes / Ideas:
