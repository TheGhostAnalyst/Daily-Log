   - Had a pinch of trouble with for loops
   - Had to go back to some of my formal notes
  

4. Solutions / Learnings:
   - Continue creating more projects 
   - Understand further parts of file handling then move to debugging
   - Always try to test every snippet of code written in the book i learn from
  

5. Notes / Ideas:
   - I can actually use for loops while saving contents to a file
   - And also learned about exception e on module webbrowser while dealing with lightshot opener to detect 404 not found links when opening links in browser
