1. Goals for Today:
   - Basic file handling with python
   - Build a project on file handling
   - Make sure i level up in someway
   

2. Tasks Completed:
   - I learnt and understood understand how to check path validity using is_file(), is_dir() and exists()
   - I learnt the process of reading and writing to a file
   - I created a password manager tool with i built most myself and had little help from AI
   - Modified my web scrapper script to be recognized by other bots as a human with headers to avoid multiple ip flagging and blocking
   
  

3. Challenges / Issues:
   - Made little mistakes when i was building the project, i used .append() instead or just changing the internal 'r' to 'a' after with open
   - Made mistake in the script while trying to show where passwords were stored i ues Path.cwd() then plus /(path) which could cause problems in some OSes
     so the solution is to use {Path('password_manager.txt).resolve()}
   - I really shouldn't always try to make all my scripts perfect, silly me, i add more features coz i curious 
  

4. Solutions / Learnings:
   - Continue creating more projects 
   - Understand further parts of file handling
   - Always try to test every snippet of code written in the book i learn from
  

5. Notes / Ideas:
   - I understood how to navigate files with efficiency 
   - And am not afraid to go again tomorrow
  

6. Mood / Energy Level:
   - 8/10 
   - productive day
