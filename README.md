# 📓 The Ghost Analyst – Daily Learning Log

> _"Consistency beats talent when talent doesn’t show up."_  

Welcome to my **Daily Learning Log** — a repository where I document what I learn each day as a self-taught cybersecurity enthusiast, recon scripter, and Python automation builder.


## 🧠 What Is This?

This repo is my personal **learning journal**, where I log:

- 🐍 **Python scripting** challenges and discoveries  
- 🔍 **OSINT and recon techniques**  
- 🧰 **Tool development progress** (bugs, breakthroughs, features)  
- 📚 Concepts I’m studying (Regex, Web Scraping, Red Teaming, etc.)
- 🧪 Experiments, code snippets, and random tests



## 🗂️ Log Structure

Each log entry is organized by **date** (YYYY-MM-DD) and contains:

```bash
📅 Date: 2025-08-21
📌 Topics:
- Regex pattern testing
- Experimented with headless scraping using Selenium
- Built a simple email extractor

🧠 Takeaways:
- Learned how to escape special regex characters
- Discovered stealth mode options in headless Chrome
````

All logs are stored in the `/logs` directory or in markdown files by current dates of logs (e.g. `2025-08-21.md`).



## 🚀 Why I Do This

* 🔁 To **track my growth**
* 🛠️ To **review past lessons and avoid repeating mistakes**
* 📢 To **showcase my consistency and curiosity** in learning
* 🔍 To create a knowledge base for future reference


## 🧩 Tools & Topics I Explore

* Python (automation, CLI, scripting)
* Regex for intelligence extraction
* OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
* Google Dorking techniques
* Web scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
* Basic cybersecurity principles
